# You need to use Github to turn in your exercises#

## Prerequisites ##

You need to create a Github account and for each assignment, you need to create a repository. 
Note: your repositories will be public unless you [request a private one](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new)


## The Process ##
 0. Create a new repository.  Make it private if you can... github will give out a free Micro account that can create 5 private repos with new student accounts.
 ![Create Repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shuri-w205/exercise-submission-howto/master/open_new_repo.png "Create Repo")

 1. Add shuri-w205 as a collaborator
 ![Add Collaborator](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/1_5-Collaborators.png?raw=true "Add Collaborator")

 2. [Create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) of your repository for the homework. 
 ![Create a Branch](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/1-CreateBranchOnGithub.png?raw=true "Create a branch")

 3. Clone the repository to a local directory
  ![Git Clone](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/2-GitClone.png?raw=true "Git Clone")

 4. Change to the local branch of the same branch name as what was created in Github earlier
  ![Git Local Branch](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/3-LocalNewBranch.png?raw=true "Git Local Branch")

 5. Create/Add any homework files to the local branch/directory
 
 6. Commit your created/added files to the local branch
  ![Commit to Local Branch](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/4-AddCommitHW.png?raw=true "Commit to Local Branch")

 7. Push your local branch back up to Github
  ![Push to Github](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/5-PushNewBranchToGithub.png?raw=true "Push to Github")

 8. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your created branch to master for the code you'd like to turn in by clicking the Compare & pull request button
  ![Pull Request](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/6-PullRequest.png?raw=true "Pull Request")

 9. On the right hand sign of the "Open a Pull Request" screen, select the Assignee gear, and assign shuri-w205 to the issue.
  ![Assignee](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/6.5-Assignee.png?raw=true "Assignee")

 10. Your instructor can now view the pull request and grade the assignment.  **Please do not merge the pull request.**
  ![Pull Request](https://github.com/MIDS-W205/Assignments/raw/master/screens/7-FinalOutput.png?raw=true "Pull Request")
 
 11. Once your instructor has graded the assignment, your pull request is merged as a final notification.
 12. You can now delete the branch as the changes have been merged with the master.
